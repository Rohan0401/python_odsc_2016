This respository contains files associated with Peter's Ukraine 2014
scikit-learn tutorial that is a slightly modified version of Jake VanderPlas's
PyCon 2014 tutorial: https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_pycon2014 .


## Installation Notes
This tutorial will require recent installations of *numpy*, *scipy*,
*matplotlib*, *scikit-learn*, and *ipython* with ipython notebook.
The last one is important: you should be able to type

    jupyter notebook

in your terminal window and see the notebook panel load in your web browser.
We are using Python 2 for logistical purposes. Participants should plan to use
Python 2.6 or 2.7 for this tutorial.

For users who do not yet have these  packages installed, a relatively
painless way to install all the requirements is to use a package such as
[Anaconda](http://www.continuum.io/downloads "Anaconda"), which can be
downloaded and installed for free.

## Downloading the Tutorial Materials
I would highly recommend using git, not only for this tutorial, but for the
general betterment of your life.  Once git is installed, you can clone the
material in this tutorial by using the git address shown above:

    git clone git@github.com:hamelsmu/python_odsc_2016.git

If you can't or don't want to install git, there is a link above to download
the contents of this repository as a zip file.  I may make minor changes to
the repository in the days before the tutorial, however, so cloning the
repository is a much better option.


## Notebook Listing
 To modify the notebooks, first download the tutorial repository, change to the
 notebooks directory, and type ``jupyter notebook``.  You should see the list in
 the jupyter notebook launch page in your web browser.

Note that some of the code in these notebooks will not work outside the
directory structure of this tutorial, so it is important to clone the full
repository if possible.
